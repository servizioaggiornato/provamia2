#### About this tool:

Your laptop or desktop doesn't have GPS capability, nevertheless, Windows 10 can figure out where you are. How? Using Wi-Fi positioning (as well as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address). The results are pretty accurate.

Wi-Fi positioning system (WiPS/WFPS) is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and other wireless access points to discover where a device is located.

The most common localization technique used is based on measuring the intensity of the received signal and the method of "fingerprinting", that includes parameters as its SSID and MAC address. There are several databases with a ton of access point information, managed by Apple, Microsoft, Google and others companies. Google allows you remove your access point data when you include '_nomap" at the end of your SSID, like SSID_nomap.

Location Services on Windows 10 are enabled by default, and can be easly hacked, compromizing the privacy.

WinLocation is a payload that can explore devices with Location Services enabled, grabbing the geolocation stored and send it to the attacker.

Disabling location tracking:

Press Win+I >> Privacy >> Location >> Turn Off Location Service
